				<p>
					Since the beginning of website development, I have tried to create more and more websites,
					which people will use. I have always been interested in this
					branch. The first sites I developed were specifically for Creagoo.
				</p>
				<p>
					On
					<a href="//creagoo.ru/site.html" class="link" target="_blank"
						>page</a
					>
					Creagoo "Website development in 4 years" I briefly told you what
					I used technologies when creating past sites. He told me briefly and
					did not tell me at all about the innovations in the site creagoo.ru . Let's fix it!
				</p>
				<h3>Website of 2019 in PHP</h3>
				<p>
					The first product that went to the masses is a PHP website with code in the database
					MySQL data. The solution looked really weak and not optimal. I
					didn't optimize the code, almost didn't use any styles. Just started
					develop in this direction.
				</p>
				<p>
					In general, the first site that I developed was on pure HTML, and
					the solution using PHP and even a database seems to be stronger,
					but in fact, I did not go far from the previous solution on HTML, because
					PHP was used as a receiver of pages from the database.
				</p>
				<p>
					In fact, I could use all the same HTML pages, which would be
					it is much more convenient because of the use of IDLE in programming. Yes, I don't
					he said, but I wrote the code for the site in a simple input field. I can not
					to describe how difficult it was.
				</p>
				<h3>I took the finished layout</h3>
				<p>
					The next step — I took the finished layout from the site with examples and
					uploaded it to the website in HTML format. At this time, I begin to study that
					what are tags and what are they for. I began to advance a little in HTML and
					my site structure was changed: I gave up the extra backend and
					switched completely to a static solution.
				</p>
				<p>
					The only problem with this approach was that I couldn't
					use modularity on the site. all duplicate elements on the site
					they are taken out in separate files, but at that moment I had not yet moved to
					this solution, which made the development more difficult.
				</p>
				<p>
					But this site has already used a better approach to creating
					paged paged. I finally started using styles, which is why the site became
					look more presentable.
				</p>
				<p>
					Now there is incomplete support for mobile devices. Incomplete
					because of my inexperience in website development. I did not understand well that
					must be included in the support of the mobile version.
				</p>
				<h3>WordPress Trojan Horse</h3>
				<p>
					I have been preparing the server for a long time to use the WordPress CMS, because I have
					an old version of PHP was installed on the server, and the ability to update
					I didn't have a PHP version. Because of this, I had to "guess" the version
					CMS WordPress to choose the right one.
				</p>
				<p>
					I will say right away — I am dissatisfied with the use of CMS WordPress because of
					lack of optimization on the site. CMS tries to download all the files, but
					does not think at all about the approach to downloading and optimizing materials on
					the site.
				</p>
				<p>
					If we analyze a large number of CMS systems and sites that
					they are written on them — you can contemplate a slow and unoptimized
					loading site pages. Although this is the most important factor.
				</p>
				<p>
					I am already silent about accessibility for persons with disabilities or the possibility of
					use the full functionality of HTML from the CMS WordPress editor. By the way,
					the WordPress CMS editor is really inconvenient. I used it and
					almost all the time I immediately switched to a view with HTML code.
				</p>
				<h3>Bootstrap 5</h3>
				<p>
					Because of the big problems with a CMS system like WordPress, I decided
					refuse to use CMS systems for the site, and switched to
					learning PHP and the Bootstrap 5 framework.
				</p>
				<p>
					I have already tried to develop a website on Bootstrap, but then there were only 4
					the version of the framework, and I failed to make friends with the framework.
					Decided to give up using Bootstrap, but after a while again
					I switched to its study and application.
				</p>
				<p>
					I began to look at the examples that are available to me for use
					components. I was looking at what my site might look like in the examples. And the day
					Every day I added more and more elements to the site to make friends with
					a framework.
				</p>
				<p>
					I started adding JavaScript to the site to be able to change the theme. I
					tried to make the most of PHP's capabilities, and started
					use modularity on the site. What happiness it was for me,
					when I was able to put many elements of the site into separate files, from where
					they are easy to connect and use on all pages.
				</p>
				<p>
					I worked for a long time in a bunch of PHP + Bootstrap 5. Changed the structure
					of the project, I added something new, but I was faithful to PHP. Until the moment when
					haven't tried anything new for the site.
				</p>
				<h3>And this is new — the Gulp package collector</h3>
				<p>
					It turns out to be much easier to create websites with Gulp. At the output I get
					the most simple website in HTML already with all the necessary elements on
					page.
				</p>
				<p>
					Gulp allows you to configure the build of a project in a folder according to the specified rules:
					optimization, replacement, compression, modularity and availability. Wrote the code
					it has become much nicer and easier. I'm really glad I switched to
					using Gulp.
				</p>
				<p>
					I haven't been able to get the package collector to work for a long time because of
					moreover, but after 2 years of my torment, I managed to force him
					work. But now I add a lot of interesting things to the site.
				</p>
				<h3>Site Innovations 2023</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Instead of an extra backend server in PHP, static ones are used
						pages, which expands the possibility of a simpler and more possible
						access to the content of pages
					</li>
					<li>
						Simplified website development and cleaner code makes it easier and
						it's faster to add new content to the site
					</li>
					<li>
						Because of the better development, the site itself began to look more beautiful and better,
						therefore, people want to stay on the site more willingly
					</li>
					<li>
						Great flexibility in the configuration of the assembly allows you to create a variety of
						web platform solutions
					</li>
					<li>
						Support for people with disabilities so that everyone has
						there was an opportunity to receive content on equal rights

						users: svg logos for maximum size,
						webp images for fast loading, woff2 font format for
						maximum optimization and much more.
					</li>
				</ol>

				<p>
					I'm glad you're staying with Creagoo. Stay tuned for new games. And good luck!
