					Recently I
					<a href="/en/p/macbook-pro-2014-13- review/" class="link">wrote</a> about
					buying your MacBook as a programming device.
					Initially, I had no desire to completely switch to the ecosystem
					Apple, because I thought that one MacBook would be enough for me. But
					as it turned out later, the transition to the Apple ecosystem is absolutely correct
					step.
				</p>
				<h3>What was the reason for my purchase</h3>
				<p>
					I decided to try the iPhone 6s for 2 reasons: I wanted
					try the Apple ecosystem and it was interesting for me to build an application
					for iOS. And my acquaintance turned out to be very pleasant, so I decided
					completely switch to the Apple ecosystem.
				</p>
				<h3>First impression of your first iPhone</h3>
				<p>
					System thoughtfulness, animations, ecosystem, application thoughtfulness,
					Great colors and nice materials are all you'll get from
					an Apple device.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is often said that the use of iPhones is incredibly pleasant, and in this
					and you really get convinced in practice. What a great job she did
					You notice Apple in full in small details, worked out
					the interface and the absence of inconveniences.
				</p>
				<p>
					I can safely recommend buying an iPhone as my own
					the main device, if you are not facing special tasks, for
					solutions that the iPhone will not seem so strong from the technical side
					sides.
				</p>
				<h3>Great iPhone 6s amenities</h3>
				<p>
					Until that time, I used only android smartphones and knew about
					the convenience of iPhones is only according to people. Yes, even if I sometimes have
					it turned out to use iPhones and even for some time
					however, this experience cannot be called a usage experience, after
					which I will be able to speak out.
				</p>
				<p>
					I was really interested in using the iPhone as a
					the main device and find out what impressions I will get from
					Apple ecosystems. I was also interested in using the download
					my iPhone projects.
				</p>
				<p>
					I decided to choose the iPhone 6s because of its relevance, price and size.
					To buy a fully working device from Apple for 10% of the price is incredible
					happiness is for experience. It is unlikely that I will be able to describe the incredible
					the quality of this device, but I will try.
				</p>
				<h3>Differences between an iPhone and an android phone</h3>
				<p>
					First of all, integration with other Apple devices has been completed
					excellent. Yes, other companies have this, but their solutions are weaker and I
					I do not use the equipment of one company.
				</p>
				<p>
					The display transmits colors perfectly and there are no problems with pixels: technology
					The Retina screen increases the number of pixels by 2 times, which is why
					perception is much better.
				</p>
				<p>
					Tactile pleasure gives everyone more new emotions and allows
					create more and more new content.
				</p>
				<p>
					The device is inexpensive, unlike other devices. Due to
					this means losing or forgetting the device is not so scary and will not cost
					It's so dear to you.
				</p>
				<p>
					The back cover of the iPhone is made of aluminum, which is why it is not possible to break it
					it seems possible. And the materials are nice, and the phone looks
					pretty enough.
				</p>
				<h3>iPhone 6s problems</h3>
				<p>
					The device is already very old and some iOS 15 innovations for
					the phone has a very bad effect on performance and convenience.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is difficult to buy a fully working device for adequate money. Hurry up
					In total, you will buy a phone that has already been sold once, or a phone with some
					compromises. For example, 3 iPhone 6s passed through my hands with
					the following problems: the switch did not work on one phone
					silent mode, the display was replaced on one phone, on one
					the phone had a battery with 70%.
				</p>
				<p>
					As mentioned above: the device has already had a lot of time and for this
					for a long time, the battery will definitely spend a huge amount of its capacity.
					The problem is that there is already a small software installed in this device
					the volume of the battery, so it also spent most of its capacity.
					My iPhone usage has shown that it lasts for 3-4 hours
					active use with 100% battery.
				</p>
				<h3>Conclusion</h3>
				<p>
					I can advise this device to those who want to try the iPhone in
					as the main device without any special attachments. Past
					supported by iOS â€” 15, so the perception from the device will be
					as much as possible. But use iPhone 6s as the main device
					in 2023 , it is not possible or will be given very
					difficult.
