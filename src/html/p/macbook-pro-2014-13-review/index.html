					My main occupation is programming. That's why I
					I need mobility, accessibility and convenience of the device on which I am
					programming. I can often hear that a macbook is a great
					a device for creative people and programmers, including. Let's try
					to sort out why people share such an opinion.
				</p>
				<h3>How I bought it</h3>
				<p>
					My model can no longer be found in the official store or in stock
					as leftovers. I looked at Internet sites where people exhibit
					their old goods for sale. The main advantage of such Internet sites
					the fact that you can get an old technique. But the minus is on similar
					sites may cheat or sell a device with technical
					problems. Therefore, you should carefully approach the purchase of equipment on
					in these markets or entrust the purchase to a specialist.
				</p>
				<p>
					I managed to find a great ad with a market price for
					the device. It is almost impossible to find a non-used device, because it has passed
					too much time since the purchase. I bought the device already with
					some problems on the display that do not affect the operation. Also
					the battery was poorly glued and there were 3 bolts missing from the back on
					the lid.
				</p>
				<h3>There is a macbook, there are Windows devices — what to choose</h3>
				<p>
					I always thought that the answer to this question is different for each person.
					In fact, it really is, because a huge number of
					people are supported by macbooks, and another number of people give
					Windows preference.
				</p>
				<p>
					Why do people argue about the choice of equipment? The fact is that the MacBook is more
					a unique device than a regular Windows laptop. Often
					it turns out that for a higher price, less is installed in the macbook
					RAM, less ssd memory, smaller diagonal and, it would seem
					, less performance in tests compared to
					a Windows laptop for the same price.
				</p>
				<p>
					But here's what I've learned from my experience — not all people are ready
					to give a big price for a macbook, not understanding why it is so expensive
					worth. Yes, the price is really big, I would not like to disassemble, from
					why is such a price formed, but I would like to devote more time
					compared to an average Windows laptop and my MacBook.
				</p>
				<h3>Criticism of Windows</h3>
				<p>
					I will inform you right away that I will not say what kind of model I am, because
					I use my workstation on Windows as a PC and features
					heavily modified. Here we are talking purely about my experience of using it.
				</p>
				<p>
					What is true: Windows is a very unstable system with
					lack of animations and ugly interface. The fact that the interface
					ugly is confirmed by the fact that it has already been fixed in Windows 11.
				</p>
				<p>
					In about 3 years of Windows operation, I saw a blue screen 30-40 times,
					that's a lot. He appeared because of the stupidest reasons, for example
					due to the lack of drivers for some component, but the blue screen did not
					appear if you wait 1-2 minutes on the boot screen.
				</p>
				<p>
					Now on my Windows the current problem is there is no English language.
					In order for English to appear, I need to add 3 languages, after which
					my English will appear. The problem is that he can't always
					to appear, and it will happen only after a while. It didn't help me
					reinstalling Windows, so I have to put up with this
					a problem.
				</p>
				<p>
					Windows is very easy to clog, I can't describe how much. Literally through
					after a year of active use, there are 15 GB left on my main disk.
					memory and I had to reinstall Windows again, and then clean
					my disk.
				</p>
				<p>
					In my life, I have been using Windows for more than 10 years and I want it
					I don't have to criticize, I'm just voicing what really exists.
					For example, in Windows 10 there are components with Windows XP or else
					early versions of Windows. The same control panel began to "disappear"
					only in Windows 11, and even then, not completely.
				</p>
				<p>
					I really have a lot of questions about Windows. During
					I have a lot of inconveniences at work. Yes, talk about
					the fact that Windows is terrible will be incorrect, because it is in full
					the volume allows me to do work, use the installed
					use hardware and test new features.
				</p>
				<p>
					I can't completely abandon Windows, otherwise I would do this
					it's been a long time. But often you have to do a routine: cleaning,
					deletion, modification, and so on.
				</p>
				<h3>About macOS</h3>
				<p>
					I can't voice anything like that about macOS. It's unlikely that All the matter is
					that only six months have passed since the purchase of the macbook, because I already
					I managed to use OpenCore, try out over 5 macOS and
					to remain as satisfied as possible in the matter of choosing a technique.
				</p>
				<p>
					I don't need to install various systems to clean my
					macOS. I don't need to reinstall it every time so that it doesn't
					clogged up. I have no questions that my technique is "stupid" because
					my macbook fully allows me to solve the tasks that I need
					are needed.
				</p>
				<p>
					Perhaps the main difference between macOS and Windows is that macOS where
					more thoughtful and smarter. After installing the program, macOS itself offers
					delete the installation file. In case of installing the program from
					an unknown macOS source will warn about this.
				</p>
				<p>
					Every step I take is tied to a resolution: the program does not have the ability to
					get access to the system without my permission. Any program I can
					it is convenient to download from the App Store in two clicks. Programs are conveniently stored in
					a folder and I can access applications like, for example, from my
					iphone or iPad.
				</p>
				<p>
					Excellent software optimization. Incredible quality and convenience
					usage. After installing the zip archive from the macOS browser itself
					it will unzip it and I will only need to use the folder. I have
					All when there is an opportunity to close some program. Due to an error in
					the macOS program will not hang.
				</p>
				<p>
					I had a problem once: I opened Safari and couldn't get it
					to close. The keyboard shortcut didn't work, and the "End Safari" item was
					unavailable. I had to shut down the system, after which the macbook
					he warned me about the error that had occurred and offered to send a report.

				<h3>Macbook model</h3>
				<p>
					My choice fell on the Macbook Pro 13’ 2014. Do not be afraid of the year of release, I
					boldly solve All tasks related to programming, viewing
					content and other things and have no problems. By the way, installed
					operating system macOS Big Sur 11.7.
				</p>
				<p>
					I used macOS Monterey on this macbook — there are some
					problems because the operating system is not officially
					supported. I got an error related to the hash of the main
					disk and I decided to stop using it officially
					unsupported macOS. Moreover, there is an officially supported
					macOS Big Sur, differences between these operating systems
					they are minimal and I am completely satisfied with everything.
				</p>
				<h3>Advantages of the macbook</h3>
				<p>
					<i>The display</i> of the MacBook is incredible. Retina technology doubles
					the number of display pixels, which is why you won't see pixels here.
					Excellent calibration of the display will allow you to enjoy the colors,
					which are as close as possible to real colors from life.
				</p>
				<p>
					<i>The keyboard</i> leaves only pleasant impressions. If you choose
					the model is up to 16 years old, you will have a keyboard of a different format, with a large
					by the stroke of the keys. It is this keyboard that I like much more, because
					that I'm used to the low stroke of the keys. After 16 years in macbooks
					a butterfly keyboard was installed, which is prone to sticking and
					has a lower key stroke.
				</p>
				<p>
					I had no problems with the <i>battery</i>. Device
					it is comfortable to use and solve problems without necessarily connecting
					the macbook to the power source.
				</p>
				<p>
					Beautiful <i>macOS</i>, about which I said a lot of good things already above.
				</p>
				<p>
					Excellent optimization of <i>programs</i>, which will fully allow
					get comfort: mount, program, write text,
					do graphics and other things.
				</p>
				<p>
					Incredible integration with the <i>Apple ecosystem</i>, which allows me
					connect my devices into a single communication, exchange data,
					use seamless dispatch of materials and not experience any
					discomfort in the issue of sending data.
				</p>
				<h3>Problems of this MacBook</h3>
				<p>
					As mentioned above — this MacBook has been on the market for 8 years and buy
					a brand new device is not possible, with a huge
					the probability is that you will buy a once-used device, so
					called used.
				</p>
				<p>
					On my device, the battery was poorly glued to the case, so it
					hanging out. Fixed the moment very simply — I bought a two-sided
					scotch tape and well glued the battery to the case so that it no longer
					staggered in the case.
				</p>
				<p>
					I replaced the thermal paste on the laptop for better performance and
					less heating.
				</p>
				<p>
					There were also 3 bolts missing from the back of the lid. I ordered from the store
					bolts for your laptop model and successfully replaced them. Be
					be careful that you order bolts specifically for your laptop model.
					Note that some bolts are attached at an angle to the lid. And yet, 2
					bolts will be of a smaller size — these two bolts need to be fixed
					in the side where the cooling hole is located.
				</p>
				<p>
					All this was exactly on my device, when buying you can
					inspect the device and choose a device with a smaller number
					defects. By the way, I also have a desire to order legs for a laptop
					and replace them too.
				</p>
				<p>
					And now about the model itself: since the production of this device
					a lot of time has passed, because of which the battery has lost a lot
					the amount of its capacity and it should be replaced.
				</p>
				<p>
					The most terrible defect that exists on this model is the display. And
					it's not about its quality, no, the quality is incredible. And the layer that
					this display is covered. The display on this laptop is by no means
					you can't get wet. It should not get drops of water or any other
					liquids.
				</p>
				<p>
					On my MacBook, I decided to stick a film on the display to avoid
					direct contact with a drop of water or any other liquid. If on
					this display will get liquid — the display will start to bubble and
					to make divorces that cannot be removed. So you too
					I recommend gluing the film. It does not distort the color and does not interfere with it
					work.
				</p>
				<p>
					The only thing I would highlight is that the diagonal of 13 inches is too small for
					basically a workstation, and I was convinced of this in practice. Macbook
					incredibly convenient and comfortable. I can't part with him for a minute.
					a minute, but sometimes there is a desire to reduce the zoom
					interface or perform other operations to increase the number of
					content on the monitor.
				</p>
				<p>
					I solve the problem with the diagonal by connecting an external monitor, on
					which I perform operations related to the code. That's why I'm in
					I remain fully satisfied and do not want to change anything.
				</p>
				<h3>How do I use a macbook</h3>
				<p>
					In general, I came up with the idea of buying a lightweight laptop after I was in
					once again I took my laptop with me, which weighs about
					one and a half to two kilograms. Some time ago I was not so strong
					I am sure to buy a MacBook. I just wished for a light
					a device on which it will be convenient for me to solve my tasks.
				</p>
				<p>
					I can't find a valid decent device on Windows
					it turned out, and I haven't been looking for so long. As a result, the choice fell on a macbook and in
					the end I bought it for myself.
				</p>
				<p>
					As I said above, I needed a lightweight device for
					programming and other tasks. I often go on a "journey",
					I don't need a laptop with a 4090, just good technology is enough for me,
					which I will be pleased to use.
				</p>
				<p>
					Sometimes I use a macbook at home. For example, I type text on it or
					do some work on it. I have a laptop that is in
					as the main working device to which I connect
					I use the keyboard and use an external monitor.
				</p>
				<h3>Conclusion</h3>
				<p>
					The article does not have a large technical part, it is aimed at answering the
					question "For whom a MacBook is best suited" and "Is it worth taking
					try it." Not everyone will have such an impression of the purchase
					devices, All depends on the person himself and his tasks.
				</p>
				<p>
					Personally, I am absolutely happy to use a macbook for programming and
					other tasks. I can recommend it!
