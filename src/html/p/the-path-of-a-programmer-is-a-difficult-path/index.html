					The question posed in the title may seem more likely to someone
					more rhetorical than the truth demanding an answer. But rather the question carries in
					imagine not the meaning of the answer "Yes" or "No", but a deeper study of the question
					difficulties of the programmer's activity.
				</p>
				<p>
					Before you start, you should figure out who the coder is, and who is
					programmer. The coder is the person responsible for writing the code. When you
					you study some material and repeat it - you are a coder, from the word
					"code".
				</p>
				<p>
					And a programmer is a person who solves technical issues with the help of
					programming. The main difference between a coder and a programmer like me
					I think that the coder does not come up with a solution to the problem and does not
					thinks over their technical component.
				</p>
				<p>
					To put it in a more intelligent language: the coder works according to a predetermined
					the algorithm, and the programmer is responsible for the development of this algorithm.
				</p>
				<h3>Difficulties at the beginning of the path</h3>
				<p>
					It is impossible to answer the question unequivocally, because everyone is waiting for their own special
					way. But what can I learn from my experience…
				</p>
				<p>
					At the beginning of learning programming and a specific language
					a programmer may think that he knows and understands already
					All programming. Yes, in many ways it manifests itself in others
					responsible tasks during the study, but exclude the influence of this
					the fact will be wrong.
				</p>
				<p>
					We will get off without having studied algorithms, but having gone only through the basics of a programmer
					can stop getting carried away with technical tasks to solve, because
					that he will think that he already knows everything. As you understand — this is erroneous
					mind. It is worth continuing to study the programming language and after a while
					You will be able to understand that you really do not know most of the tasks,
					which need to be studied and solved.
				</p>
				<p>
					Personally, I have encountered some unpleasant problem, which may
					talk about various information materials on the Internet, talking about
					problems that will be waiting for the programmer.
				</p>
				<h3>What will the programmer expect in the future</h3>
				<p>
					Personally, I can highlight some interval at the beginning when studying
					it will become very difficult. You will get into some "pit". This problem
					characterizes uncertainty in the further path of study
					programming. You won't understand what you need to do. What
					to study. What to try.
				</p>
				<p>
					In some cases, this "pit" may be caused by the fact that you
					they did not study the basics of the programming language deeply enough, but immediately
					are you going to study some major framework of this language
					programming that is completely based on the basics of this language
					programming.
				</p>
				<h3>Burnout</h3>
				<p>
					Probably the worst thing that can wait for a programmer is burnout.
					Only after passing through it can we say what it is. On your way
					I have already managed to burn out 2 times from the project.
				</p>
				<p>
					I want to say right away that not All programmers know what exactly
					this is it. Basically, this is due to the fact that this phenomenon is noticed
					well, it's very difficult.
				</p>
				<p>
					Burnout for someone may be similar with simple fatigue. But if
					ordinary physical fatigue can be neutralized by ordinary rest, then
					here's how to deal with moral fatigue? We'll sort it out a little later.
				</p>
				<p>
					What is the difference between burnout and normal fatigue? I can't say for sure.
					It is worth being afraid of both in order to avoid the possible
					burnout. The fact is that burnout is the first stage of the future
					depression. It is worth realizing the seriousness of this problem.
				</p>
				<h3>How to deal with the listed problems</h3>
				<p>
					First of all, I recommend creating a time interval that you
					you will be able to allocate for programming. From what time and until what hour you
					are personally allowed to do programming. This temporary
					the interval will help to avoid night gatherings on a laptop. In any
					In this case, you will leave only 20% of the code written at night in the project.
				</p>
				<p>
					The advice to break away from the workplace will also be very useful. And
					it is from the workplace. You should just change the atmosphere. For example,
					you can go outside, go somewhere or go to another
					a room. Do not neglect this advice, because the work can be
					more successful up to 40%.
				</p>
				<p>
					Fight against burnout: it is difficult to notice burnout in advance, but it is possible.
					As soon as you have a desire to take a break from the project in your head or
					you realize that you are a little tired of programming — these signals
					it is worth fixing and starting to act. If you don't have the strength with me
					to do anything — you need to break away from All things until the moment you
					you will not "burn" again on your favorite business.
				</p>
				<h3>Benefits and advantages</h3>
				<p>
					If you have a lot of energy to work, but this particular case does not
					attract you, and you need to solve the issue, then there are 2 ways: to solve the issue through
					force or start doing things close to the task. After four years
					active programming, I prefer the second one more
					the method, but we will analyze the consequences of each of the cases.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you solve the issue through force, your code will be weak, rather
					Allgo you will use either ready-made and invented solutions or
					Your solutions will not be reliable. And as a result, you will successfully bring yourself to
					burnout and you will have to take a long pause in All programming.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you begin to solve problems close to the one that you are facing, here
					what advantages can you get: You will solve the problem, you will not
					you will get tired, you will rest from the business from which you
					tired. In general — there are some advantages! Therefore, I recommend doing exactly
					so.
				</p>
				<p>
					In conclusion, I would like to wish everyone more strength and
					less fatigue. Good luck!
