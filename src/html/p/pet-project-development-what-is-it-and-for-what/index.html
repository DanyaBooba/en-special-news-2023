					It is worth understanding from the very beginning what a pet project and a project in
					as a whole. The project is your invented idea, implemented technically.
					To put it more simply, a project means some kind of
					a solution, some kind of application, website or game.
				</p>
				<p>
					To study programming, it is worth developing your own
					projects of different directions to understand the programming language
					better and to gain more experience.
				</p>
				<h3>Pet project - what is it</h3>
				<p>
					A pet project is the same project as usual, but created based on
					out of personal interests. Most often, pet projects are needed for studying
					some new technology, expanding knowledge and gaining new experience
					in the field of programming.
				</p>
				<h3>Why do I need to run my pet project</h3>
				<p>
					As mentioned above, a pet project can help to better study some
					technology, try out a new technological solution, come up with something
					interesting or distract from the main activity.
				</p>
				<p>
					Often a pet project is not brought to a meaningful end, pet projects carry
					the main task is technical. Learn something, try something out.
					It makes sense to create such a project only for a programmer who
					engaged in the development of the project.
				</p>
				<p>
					But a pet project can also be output to a regular project format if
					think over its internal component for other users. Often
					that's exactly what they do. After changing the pet project to a full-fledged project
					the solution can get enough demand from users and even help
					Author to earn money, help solve a problem, or receive
					popularity for your name.
				</p>
				<p>In conclusion, I would like to wish you good luck in running pet projects!</p>
