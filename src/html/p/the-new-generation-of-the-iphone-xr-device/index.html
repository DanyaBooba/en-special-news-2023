				<p>
					I've always been interested in trying out a new Apple device and my
					the choice fell on the iPhone Xr due to its popularity and convenience.
				</p>
				<p>
					It turned out that I switched to iPhone Xr with 6s, and my
					there was no limit to the surprise!
				</p>
				<h3>Amenities</h3>
				<p>
					Face ID is a very convenient feature. I often have a wet situation
					fingers, so I don't like the option with a fingerprint. Almost
					I have to enter a password all the time. And the password I often have to
					enter because of the large amount of information that needs to be protected.
					I was able to forget about the password while using Face ID.
				</p>
				<p>
					And Face ID works out quite accurately. I had no problems like
					at the Apple presentation. He always finds out. Let it happen that I enter
					password, I definitely made friends with this function.
				</p>
				<p>
					The phone has a very convenient form factor. Its really nice
					hold it in your hand, it doesn't cut my hands, but reach to the edges of the screen
					it is possible if you use swipes.
				</p>
				<p>
					A new device for me, a new processor and new computing
					cores. The operation of the phone is much more stable and reliable than the 6s. I have better
					there are Games, programs. They load faster. And they are displayed better. I
					like it, even if I don't work so much in programs on my phone,
					convenience is really important to me.
				</p>
				<p>
					And I fell in love with bangs. Before that, I thought I would never buy myself
					a phone with a cutout. And now I really like bangs. But,
					perhaps it is the bangs. I'm not used to other "perversions" yet.
				</p>
				<p>
					Bangs do not interfere with viewing the content. In any case, with its help we
					we see more content, because the side of the bangs is placed
					technical information.
				</p>
				<h3>Why iPhone Xr</h3>
				<p>
					Yes, there are SE, 11 and 12. But my choice fell on Xr because of the maximum
					the number of advantages and the minimum price for the device. At the moment
					the market price of the device is 16,000 rubles, this price includes 100% of the price
					phone number. And that's fine.
				</p>
				<p>
					Xr is the form factor of current Apple phones. Because SE
					presented in the old design. And 11 is almost no different from XR.
				</p>
				<p>
					It's been 12, 13 and 14 — talking about something else. But I didn't have enough for them
					budget, and everything suits me with the current device.
				</p>
				<p>
					I'm not going to say here what tasks Xr can be suitable for, because
					which, I think everyone can figure out for themselves what they need. In
					the case of the iPhone Xr, you can do everything on this device, without
					exceptions, and enjoy it.
				</p>
				<p>
					I can't use android phones. Not in any form. And funny,
					I'm not the only one. Let it be called in different words, Apple
					they can really please the user as much as possible.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is very comfortable to use their equipment. I want to furnish the whole house
					with Apple appliances. It is important to control this, because there are the necessary
					purchases, and there are unnecessary ones.
				</p>
				<p>In conclusion, I want to recommend the phone for purchase. See you!</p>
