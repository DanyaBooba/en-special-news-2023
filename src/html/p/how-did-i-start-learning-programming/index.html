					Programming is a very interesting direction that has received
					incredible fame in 2020 and still has fame. To a greater extent
					this is partly due to the huge demand in programmers who
					it's getting all smaller. We'll talk about remote work later.
				</p>
				<h3>First project</h3>
				<p>
					The first project that I developed on my shoulders, with which I
					my supervisor helped â€” the game project Babka On The Hunt.
					This is a different version of Games, presented on Google Play.
				</p>
				<p>
					About this game I
					<a href="//youtu.be/lKLuwC9qb-w " class="link">wrote</a>
					a podcast in which I told exactly how I developed this game and to
					what I came to in the end.
				</p>
				<p>
					I started learning programming from the C language. To be honest, it was
					incredibly difficult, because the C programming language even after
					four years of my active development is not so easy, and I'm not
					I'm talking about starting the study of programming with
					of the given language.
				</p>
				<p>
					In order to better understand the meaning of programming with my scientific
					the head decided to develop his own game project, with which
					I performed at competitions and took places.
				</p>
				<h3>My first site</h3>
				<p>
					In addition to having a game project in development, I've always had
					it's interesting to develop your own website that people will use. And I
					I also became interested in this direction.
				</p>
				<p>
					With my supervisor, we set up the server, and I sat down for
					development. The first site was far from an ideal example in
					web development, which is why I quickly replaced it with other solutions,
					I haven't reached the WordPress CMS yet.
				</p>
				<p>
					After implementing the CMS WordPress on my site, I sank a little in
					website development and I didn't like it very much. I really wanted to lead
					their sites are independently in development, which I was able to achieve after
					learning the Bootstrap framework.
				</p>
				<p>
					So I began to lead the project in development live.creagoo.ru , about which
					I wrote an article earlier. Already by this point I was actively engaged
					development of game projects and web resources.
				</p>
				<h3>Other classes</h3>
				<p>
					I also actively wrote code in Python, in which, mainly,
					he created algorithms and never worked on the development of his system,
					Because I've always used other programming languages for
					solutions to their technical problems.
				</p>
				<p>
					In Python, I wrote programs to work in the console. Created
					web resources with user authorization and solved problems with artificial
					intelligence.
				</p>
				<h3>How I got to know programming</h3>
				<p>
					All my childhood I was connected with technology: phones, laptops and
					other devices. I have always been attracted to this direction and I
					it was interesting to understand and fix crafts.
				</p>
				<p>
					My thinking allowed me to create incredible things out of lego and
					other materials from construction. Therefore, it was decided to send me to
					a 3D modeling circle, where I got acquainted with the basics,
					he continued modeling and managed to create a digital copy
					smart city.
				</p>
				<p>
					Yes, the knowledge in 3D modeling was definitely useful to me and I am sure that
					they will be useful in the future. But my main direction was chosen very
					it's not difficult: I was offered to take my free time with another circle, and I
					I decided to choose the direction of programming.
				</p>
				<p>
					I already
					<a href="/en/p/the-path-of-a-programmer-is-a-difficult-path/" class="link">wrote</a>
					an article about what awaits a programmer on his way. I would like to wish you good luck
					All those who are just starting to appear in this direction and
					moves on to learning a new programming language for him.
				</p>
				<p>
					And of course, to all the others, I also want to express a huge
					thank you and wish you all the best. Good luck!
