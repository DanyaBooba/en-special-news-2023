					In today's article I will try to tell you the methods of fighting against
					burnout and discuss the fact that burnout is scary and why it is
					it appears in people.
				</p>
				<p>
					Most often it is programmers because of the large number of monotonous
					jobs burn out from their business.
				</p>
				<h3>What is burnout</h3>
				<p>
					burnout is a state of moral fatigue, because of which there is no
					the desire to do something. burnout is the first step to
					depression. Do not underestimate this condition, because the struggle with
					burnout is not as simple as with physical fatigue.
				</p>
				<p>
					Physical fatigue is very easy to fight: We're just resting,
					we sleep off and do not strain our muscles, which is why they recover and we
					we can start straining again. But what about moral fatigue?
					The state when you are not doing anything brings a lot of
					harm, because a lot of things can depend on us and we just
					it is necessary to solve problems.
				</p>
				<h3>Fighting burnout</h3>
				<p>
					The first and most important step is to determine what exactly you have
					burnout, not just fatigue from the case. As I said above,
					programmers often suffer from burnout, because their tasks include
					monotonous work that needs to be done.
				</p>
				<p>
					But this does not mean that if you are faced with performing a monotonous
					you need to sit and do only her work. There are a couple of tips to
					do not get tired while working and do not bring yourself to burnout:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Don't sit still for a long time. Get up, walk for 5 minutes. Change
						place. Drink some water or do a warm-up. Your Brain can't All
						time to work with the same efficiency, you definitely need a rest.
					</li>
					<li>
						Try to strain less during the lesson. Do not bend your neck in
						an unnatural position. Let the font size on the device be
						comfortable. And the lighting in the room as well.
					</li>
					<li>
						Try to alternate between routine and new work. It can be very useful
						sit down for a case in which you don't need to think much. During
						after doing this kind of work, your brain will thank you because you
						switch the type of work. The brain either thinks or does something
						the same type. Don't forget about it.
					</li>
					<li>
						And, probably, the most logical and understandable: do work in
						pleasure. If at the current time you do not want to do this
						work — put it off for a while. Give yourself time to
						rest. If you realize you can't do the job
						effectively — put it off for a while, do it later.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Yes, the advice is not always working, because there are moments of strong
					tension or a hopeless situation — you need to do this thing and All. But
					such moments come to an end, and after them you can relax.
				</p>
				<p>
					I want to wish you to burn out less in the new year. And get more rest. With
					effective business results. See you!
