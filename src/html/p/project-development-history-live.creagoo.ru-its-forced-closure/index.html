				<p>
					Let's start with the basics, the project live.creagoo.ru — this is a history of learning
					Bootstrap framework. After CMS WordPress, I got a sharp
					the desire to optimize the site, and this required control
					behind the development. I was able to gain control by creating a website
					by yourself.
				</p>
				<h3>What is Bootstrap used for</h3>
				<p>
					Bootstrap carries pre-written styles and some solutions,
					using JavaScript. Using Bootstrap, you can create
					adaptive sites, without writing "basic" styles.
				</p>
				<p>
					Bootstrap was used due to the fact that with its help you can
					it's fast enough to create a simple website. This is what I decided to use and
					I began to study Bootstrap. My study of Bootstrap was reflected in the creation of
					project live.creagoo.ru .
				</p>
				<h3>The first pages created for the project live.creagoo.ru </h3>
				<p>
					First of all, it is worth saying that the project live.creagoo.ru developed
					for the Creagoo game studio, which I run. First pages —
					these are game project pages, team descriptions, and development history
					the logo. These are All basic pages, without which a large-scale site
					cannot exist.
				</p>
				<h3>Blog in the project live.creagoo.ru </h3>
				<p>
					Then I began to develop other solutions. For example, I
					developed my blog already in 2020. He was an ordinary
					a database, together with the PHP programming language, with which
					connection to the database and management of records from
					tables'.
				</p>
				<h3>
					Content personalization — personal account of the project live.creagoo.ru
				</h3>
				<p>
					After that, I decided to develop my personal account, which I was able to
					bring to mind only after 2 years in the project
					<a href="//id.creagoo.ru " class="link">aquarium</a>. Personal account
					— this is a simple test task that tests the programmer's skill
					manage data to save progress and personalize content
					for him.
				</p>
				<p>
					In creating my first personal account, I was able to do not a little
					the number of errors that were saved in the final version. Even
					after a long time of development, errors still appeared that
					interfered with the operation of the system. But if you debug and fix errors, you can without
					problems, then bad design and weak technological solutions to fix
					it was much more difficult.
				</p>
				<p>
					The selection of bad solutions for use was justified by my small
					experience in the field of web programming. I tried to make up for my
					problems and more than once completely redesigned the structure of the project. To say
					honestly, it did more harm than good. At the current time I
					I stopped bringing projects to the "ideal", because it's still impossible.
					Creating a "perfect" project is a waste of time. All that
					I want to fix it now should be left just until better times.
				</p>
				<h3>Messages in the project live.creagoo.ru </h3>
				<p>
					An interesting technological solution was also implemented in the face of
					opportunities to correspond with users. You're on your own
					you choose the person with whom you will communicate. You enter the necessary
					you send a message, a person receives it.
				</p>
				<p>
					All, as we are used to seeing in ordinary messages with people. My
					solution was distinguished by a bad technical part, which I have already stated.
					My solution required a constant page reload. Message
					it could have been sent several times after the page was reloaded. It was not
					displayed when the user last logged in to the network and whether it was possible
					should I write to him now or not.
				</p>
				<h3>Why did I start the project live.creagoo.ru </h3>
				<p>
					Project live.creagoo.ru existed as a replacement for the main site.
					CMS WordPress provided a bad technical part, weak
					optimization and the lack of the possibility of direct editing of the site.
				</p>
				<p>
					I started learning Bootstrap so that I could quickly create websites.
					I had little experience in creating my own websites on my own, so I
					I decided to use the Bootstrap framework as support.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the future I planned to replace the current site
					<a href="//creagoo.ru " class="link">creagoo.ru </a> new solution
					live.creagoo.ru . Spoiler: That's exactly what I got. Now on
					<a href="//creagoo.ru " class="link">creagoo.ru </a> the site is located,
					which I independently led in development.
				</p>
				<h3>Why I decided to stop using CMS WordPress</h3>
				<p>
					CMS WordPress helps to develop in a more convenient format. But
					more often than not, if you analyze the sites created on the WordPress CMS,
					these sites have a huge number of problems. Starting from bad
					adaptive sites, the lack of advantages of sites. Also these sites
					often have a long and unoptimized loading, images in different
					formats that are not used with COMM.
				</p>
				<p>
					Because of the problems that CMS WordPress introduces into the site being developed, I
					I decided to abandon the use of this CMS and am quite happy about it.
				</p>
				<p>
					In conclusion, I want to say that you are not afraid to learn new
					technologies. Not to be afraid of not knowing something or not being able to. This is all when you can
					it will be fixed after a while. If you believe in your business, you will definitely
					you will reach success. Good luck!
