					For 3 years of active project development in a web environment for personal
					for use and for people to order, I have brought out some form of convenient
					sorting the project. I decided to tell people about it, as I will be soon
					change the development style.
				</p>
				<h3>Structuring the project</h3>
				<p>
					First of all, it is necessary to understand the structure of the project. For a while I
					I used long names, understandable, but because of them the URL can
					lengthen. Now I prefer incomprehensible folders in the spirit of "a",
					"f", "db" and so on.
				</p>
				<p>
					At the root I keep .htaccess, which described the link to page 404,
					403 and the rules that remove the extension.php from the URL.
				</p>
				<p>
					I also keep the "i" folder in the root - here is All additional for the site:
					fonts, styles, scripts and images. There are 4 folders in the "i" folder:
					"a", "css", "img", "php".
				</p>
				<p>
					Let's start from the end. The "php" folder has 2 folders inside it: "c" and "m".
					Folder "c" is an abbreviation of the word component - parts of the site are stored here:
					footer, header, head and other styles described in advance. I'm taking out the blocks
					in modules, as it happens in ReactJS due to usability.
				</p>
				<p>
					Folder "m" is an abbreviation of the word module - handlers are stored here
					events. For example, here I store the script rb-mysql.php , allowing convenient
					access the database and the handlers that I refer to in the forms
					or links.
				</p>
				<p>
					The "img" folder stores images. Everything is simple here, the "logo" folder for
					logos and other necessary folders, divided by site categories.
				</p>
				<p>
					The "css" folder stores the CSS styles of my site. At the root I store a file
					app.css, in which I connect other CSS files using @import. Such
					the option allows me to fully work in 1 folder created for CSS
					styles and do not change the structure of the project in its other parts, thereby
					complicating things.
				</p>
				<p>
					The convenience of storing styles in one folder is also justified by
					using this option to change the topic. Together with the app.css file
					there are 2 files in the root of the "css" folder: light.css, dark.css. In two
					these files describe the colors that I use in the project. In
					depending on the current topic, I connect the necessary file, which, in the case of
					what, will change the colors on the site. Thus, there is a change of theme on
					the site.
				</p>
				<p>
					And the most interesting thing is the folder "a" - an abbreviation of the word another. More often
					Allgo here I store all the "garbage", without which it is impossible to do. I
					rarely change files and folders stored in folder "a". That's why I
					moved these files and folders to folder "a". For example, in folder "a" I store
					Bootstrap styles, fonts, JavaScript code, and database saves. In
					in which case, you can expand the number of files stored here and
					integrate other solutions needed for the project.
				</p>
				<h3>Auxiliary files needed for a high-quality website</h3>
				<p>
					But just folders and PHP files will not work. Yes, you can
					create an excellent, optimized with good accessibility website. But
					in addition to having page files, auxiliary files are also needed,
					describing the site. An ordinary person will not read these files, he
					they are not interests. These files are needed for search engine robots that
					they will check your site and go through it.
				</p>
				<p>
					The first file parsed above is .htaccess. It is needed in order, for
					example, to change the format of the URL display. Also.htaccess
					allows you to perform other actions, which can be found in
					the internet.
				</p>
				<p>
					File sitemap.xml contains the "code" in XML format. This file
					stores All the pages of the site, their priority, the time of the last
					page changes and the frequency of changes to a specific page. To
					for example, you can view this file at
					creagoo.ru/sitemap.xml.
				</p>
				<p>
					There is also a file robots.txt . It stores information for
					search engine robots. Link to the sitemap and various information for
					robots, for example, which paths are available for traversal and which are not.
				</p>
				<p>
					You should also store the icon.ico file. This file in the address bar
					it will allow you to display a small image-the site logo. Most often Allgo
					this file is needed for the uniqueness of the page in the output.
				</p>
				<p>
					We will not delete the file, but All the same, to add additional uniqueness
					the pages can use an accent color. A style is added to the head with
					the name "theme-color" and in content the color value in HTML format.
					As far as I know, Safari browser reads this information and
					displays in the header.
				</p>
				<p>
					For example, you can use an RSS file for a media site. Into it
					information about the pages is recorded. If you look at media sites,
					you will see a link to the RSS feed in footer. This is a file that stores some
					records. Often this RSS file can be connected for some social network.
					the network so that it displays your latest pages.
				</p>
				<h3>"Pure" PHP or Laravel</h3>
				<p>
					We have disassembled the structure of the site, looked at how it should be
					store project files. Now let's figure out which option should
					should I just use PHP or the Laravel framework?
				</p>
				<p>
					I will inform you that the broadcast opinion is purely my personal experience. If
					Your experience is different - that's great.
				</p>
				<p>
					I started creating my first website with pure PHP. The concept
					"pure PHP" means that the PHP programming language is used and
					nothing more. Development is a bit difficult because
					dependencies are tracked independently. There is no possibility
					integrate some solutions into your project.
				</p>
				<p>
					Laravel seems to solve these problems. Allows you to write websites
					cooler. But, for the sake of truth, I couldn't really understand the meaning of Laravel for
					usage. Yes, tests are integrated into it, personally I don't use them
					I use it, I have enough of my own testing because of the small size
					sites.
				</p>
				<p>
					Laravel allows you to share responsibility on the site: backend and
					frontend. Allows you to include files in your project. Create
					multilingual sites. Access the database. Solve problems faster.
				</p>
				<p>
					But my experience of using Laravel was associated only with pain. After
					every day my project stopped working. I started with more
					a later version of Laravel. Reinstalled, but there were still some
					problems and eternal mistakes, because of which my project did not start.
				</p>
				<p>
					I didn't like fixing problems forever. The whole point is this:
					after the introduction of the new solution, I quietly launched the project. But
					after some time, instead of starting, my console displayed
					mistakes. I work on the project on the workstation, after
					I have not changed or deleted anything from the Laravel project.
				</p>
				<p>
					Also, publishing the Laravel project to the server is incredibly difficult:
					you need to change dependencies, files. It was absolutely incomprehensible to me,
					how can I conveniently upload the project to the server. The lack of
					hospitality and pushed me away from using Laravel.
				</p>
				<h3>Programming language for processing backend requests</h3>
				<p>
					I decided to choose the PHP programming language for processing
					backend requests. The choice was made for a very simple reason: this
					the programming language has been developing for a long time, it has within itself
					good technological solutions that simplify development, for this
					the programming language has written quite a few frameworks that can
					use. And in general, I like this programming language.
				</p>
				<p>
					In fact, you can use any language you are interested in
					Programming languages: Python, C++, Rust. I don't think it's that important.
					Only if you are not creating a resource with high user turnover
					or a narrower sphere of use.
				</p>
				<p>
					In conclusion, I would like to highlight the advantages of PHP: I use it for
					modularity of my project, as a backend handler. With the help
					PHP can be given the ability to manage GET requests and work with
					forms.
				</p>
				<p>
					Use what you like the most and is suitable for the solution
					tasks. Good luck!
